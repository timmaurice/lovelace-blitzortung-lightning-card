# Some ideas or todos:

- [x] Make card ready for HACS.
- [x] Using ha-color-picker for color input in editor.
- [x] Add a graph that shows the amount of flashes the last hour in a bar chart.
  - Last 10 min white
  - 10 - 20 min yellow
  - 20 - 30 min orange
  - 30 - 40 min orange-red
  - 40 - 50 min red
  - 50 - 60 min dark-red
- [x] Show the history of the entries on the map and update the map so that all flashes are visible.
- [x] Add more translations.
- [x] Add animation when a new flash appears on the map
- [x] Show a cursor when hovering over clickable elements.
- [x] Improve radar chart performance by using the D3 enter/update/exit pattern.
- [x] Add tooltips to radar strikes to show exact distance and azimuth on hover.
- [x] Add the celestial direction (e.g. ENE, E, ESE, SE, â€¦) to the compass and the direction in the center of the compass rose.
- [x] Make N,E,S,W translatable so it's N,O,S,W in german, same translation we need for all celestial directions.
- [x] Make the entities inside of the compass clickable.
- [x] Add editor options to customize the compass colors.
- [x] Can you make the history chart's time axis configurable?
- [x] Add an option to display the timestamp of the last strike.
