A Home Assistant Lovelace card to display data from the [Blitzortung](https://github.com/mrk-its/homeassistant-blitzortung) integration. It shows the distance, direction, and total count of recent lightning strikes. It also features a compass, a radar chart for visualizing recent strike locations, a history chart, and an optional map view.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

This card requires the official [Blitzortung.org integration](https://github.com/mrk-its/homeassistant-blitzortung) to be installed and configured in Home Assistant.

You must have the following sensors from the integration:

- `sensor.blitzortung_lightning_distance`
- `sensor.blitzortung_lightning_counter`
- `sensor.blitzortung_lightning_azimuth`

For the map and radar features to work, you must also enable the creation of `geo_location` entities in the Blitzortung integration's options. The card automatically finds and uses `geo_location.lightning_strike_*` entities.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

This card is available in the [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/).

1.  Open HACS.
2.  Go to "Frontend" > "Explore & Add Repositories".
3.  Search for "Blitzortung Lightning Card" and install it.
4.  Add the card to your Lovelace dashboard.

    ```yaml
    - type: custom:blitzortung-lightning-card
      distance: sensor.blitzortung_lightning_distance
      count: sensor.blitzortung_lightning_counter
      azimuth: sensor.blitzortung_lightning_azimuth
    ```

### Manual Installation

1.  Download the `blitzortung-lightning-card.js` file from the latest release.
2.  Place it in your `config/www` directory.
3.  Add the resource reference to your Lovelace configuration.
    - URL: `/local/blitzortung-lightning-card.js`
    - Resource Type: `JavaScript Module`
4.  Add the card to your dashboard.

## Features

- Displays the distance, direction, and total count of the latest lightning strike.
- A compass rose that shows the direction of the latest strike.
- A D3.js-powered radar chart to plot the location of multiple recent strikes.
- A history chart showing the number of strikes in 10-minute intervals over the last hour.
- Optional `ha-map` integration to show strike locations relative to your home.
- Strike history is stored in the browser's local storage to persist across reloads.
- Tooltips on radar strikes show exact distance and azimuth on hover.
- Animated markers for new strikes on the map.
- Customizable colors for the compass, radar, and strikes.

## Card Configuration

The card can be configured using the visual editor.

## How It Works

The card automatically listens for new strikes by monitoring the `count` entity you provide. When a new strike is detected, the card reads the corresponding `distance` and `azimuth` and adds the strike to a list. This list is saved in your browser's local storage, so the history persists across page reloads.

**This means you no longer need to create any YAML helper or automation!** The card works out of the box.

## Visualizations

### Compass and Radar Chart

The card includes a D3.js-powered radar chart to display the location of recent lightning strikes as a polar scatter plot, overlaid on a compass rose. The strikes on the radar will gradually fade over time, with the most recent strike being the most prominent.

You can customize its appearance with these options:

- **Tooltips**: Hovering over a strike on the radar will show a tooltip with its exact distance and azimuth.
- **Radar Max Distance**: Sets the maximum range of the radar chart in your distance unit (e.g., km or mi). If you leave it blank, it will adjust automatically based on the furthest strike.
- **Radar History Size**: Controls how many of the most recent strikes are stored and displayed. The default is 20.
- **Grid Color**: Sets the color of the radar grid, compass rose, and labels.
- **Strike Color**: Sets the color of the lightning strikes on the radar and the pointer on the compass.

### History Chart

When enabled with `show_history_chart: true`, the card displays a bar chart showing the number of strikes over a configurable period. The default is 1 hour (with 10-minute intervals), but a 15-minute view (with 3-minute intervals) is also available via the `history_chart_period` option. The bars are color-coded by age, from white (most recent) to dark red (oldest).

### Map Integration

The card reads the latitude and longitude for each new strike directly from the attributes of your configured `distance` sensor (e.g., `sensor.blitzortung_lightning_distance`). It then plots the strike history on the map. If your Home Assistant `zone.home` is configured, it will also be displayed as a reference point. The map automatically zooms to fit all displayed points.

To enable this feature, simply toggle the "Show Map" option in the card's visual editor. This will set the `show_map: true` option in your YAML configuration. The previous manual setup of a `device_tracker` is no longer needed.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:blitzortung-lightning-card
title: Lightning Strikes
distance: sensor.blitzortung_lightning_distance

show_history_chart: true
history_chart_period: 15m
